Test the ideas of Charlie Pixel-ing with LEDs

I decided to try out the CharliePixel idea of usinf tri-state logic. 
I started out thinking about Christmas decorations and how i could drive lots of leds from a microcontroller that had a limited number of lines.
While playing with TinkerCad it became obvious that any microcontroller would do, so I started out with a Xiao Sam due to its small size and ease
of programming using the Arduino IDE.
